## **Aim**
To explore and understand various prompting techniques used for generating videos using AI models, and to observe how prompt structure influences video quality, style, and motion consistency.

---

## **Algorithm**
1. Identify AI video generation models and study their features.  
2. Create simple prompts to generate baseline video outputs.  
3. Refine prompts by adding descriptive details.  
4. Add time, motion, and camera-related instructions.  
5. Test multiple artistic and cinematic styles.  
6. Iteratively adjust prompts based on output quality.  
7. Generate variations of the same prompt.  
8. Save and compare all generated videos.

## **Procedure**

### **1. Explore Video Generation Models**
Evaluate popular text-to-video AI tools such as:

| Tool | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Runway Gen-2 | Text → Video | High realism, cinematic output |
| Pika Labs | Text → Video | Smooth animation, good motion |
| Synthesia | Avatar Video | Ideal for presenters & narration |
| DeepBrain | Avatar Video | Fast, realistic speech videos |

Understand each model's capabilities and limitations.

### **2. Create Simple Prompts**
Start with minimal, general prompts to check baseline generation.

### **Example Prompt:**
A person walking in a park.

### **3. Add Descriptive Details**
Enhance prompts by adding elements like:
- Environment
- Lighting
- Colors
- Expressions
- Additional objects

### **Example Prompt:**
A person in a red jacket walking through a sunny park with birds flying overhead.

### **4. Add Time & Motion Elements**
Include dynamic instructions such as:
- Time-lapse
- Slow motion
- Camera panning or zooming
- Scene transitions

### **Example Prompt:**
A time-lapse of the sunset over the ocean with the camera slowly zooming out.

### **5. Try Multiple Video Styles**
Test outputs in different aesthetics:
-  Cinematic
-  Artistic / Sketch
-  Futuristic / Sci-fi
-  2D/3D Animation

### **Example Prompt:**
An animated futuristic city at night with neon lights and flying cars.

### **6. Refine Prompts Based on Output**
Adjust prompts to improve:
- Scene accuracy
- Motion smoothness
- Lighting consistency
- Camera perspectives

### **Refined Example Prompt:**
A cinematic tracking shot of a car racing through a neon-lit city with reflections on wet streets.

### **7. Generate Multiple Prompt Variations**
Small changes in wording = big changes in output.

| Prompt | Difference |
|--------|------------|
| A cat jumping on a table. | Basic, minimal detail |
| A small orange cat leaping onto a wooden table in slow motion. | Detailed, controlled motion |

### **Save & Compare Outputs**
Analyze differences based on:
- Coherence
- Style
- Motion control
- Scene accuracy
- Prompt alignment

This helps identify the most effective prompting style.

## **Result**
The prompting techniques for AI video generation were successfully explored. Different prompt structures and styles were tested, and their effects on the resulting video outputs were analyzed.
